# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository contains the initial setup for the ALX Next.js project (Project 0x02).  
Its purpose is to provide a clean starting point for learning and practicing essential concepts such as project structure, configuration, components, routing, and general Next.js fundamentals.  

As the project progresses, additional features and examples will be added to demonstrate how a real-world Next.js application is built and organized.
